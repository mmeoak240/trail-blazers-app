Trail Blazers - The mountain bike community trail finder.

The Why:
This site was made with the intended purpose of allwoing riders to look for and add mountain biking trails that they want to ride or have ridden and wish to share with others. As a mountain biking enthusiast myself I am always in search of a new adventure and rely on other riders to discover new trails. Now while finding new places to ride is great I also wish for for riders to be able to describe the trails or update aspects of the trail with comments, such as the trail has been washed out by last weeks rain. This site also promotes a sense of community as you can see other riders activley helping each other.
