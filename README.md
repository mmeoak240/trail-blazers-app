# Trail Blazers - The mountain bike community trail finder.

## The Why:

This site was made with the intended purpose of allowing riders to look for and add mountain biking trails that they want to ride or have ridden and wish to share with others. As a mountain biking enthusiast myself I am always in search of a new adventure and rely on other riders in order to discover new trails. My hope is to promote a sense of community among riders as you can see other riders actively helping each other and sharing their experiences.

## How to get it up and running:

In order for you to be able to use this application you will first need to fork and clone it to the directory you would like it saved in. You will also need to get the server up and running in order to have access to the db.json, you'll do this by typing "npm run server" into your terminal(you would normally need to type "json-server --watch db.json" but i've edited the package.json for simplicity). If you need the json server installed you may do so by typing "npm install -g json-server" into your terminal. After all of the that just type "npm start" into the terminal and off you go.

## Features:

This application allows the user to search through all of the trails that have been posted to the site by their trail name, to navigate from the home page to this page just click the "Trails" link in the top navigation bar .

If you find a trail you are interested in you may click on the trail and a description of the trail will appear. If you've recently ridden a trail that you thought was great and can't find it anywhere on the site you may click the "Add Trail‚Äù link to navigate to the trail form where you can add a photo, trail name, location, trail difficulty and lastly a description of the trail. After submitting the form your trail will now be added to the trail list and can be searched for and selected.

## Future features:

My hope is to add the ability to filter the trail list based on difficulty so riders may find trails suited to their level of skill. I would like to add the ability for users to add trails to a favorites page so they may save trails that they enjoyed and plan on revisiting. Lastly I would like to add the ability for users to comment on the various trails to share their experiences or update trail conditions.
